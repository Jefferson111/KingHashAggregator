title: Learn about ChainUp Aggregator and Validator Nft
---

This is a brief introduction to ChainUp Aggregator and Validator Nft, ChainUp Aggregator the first staking aggregator protocol and Validator Nft is a novel mechanism for Ethereum staking offered by ChainUp. 

There are various staking protocols for staking Eth on the Ethereum network. ChainUp Aggregator is a one-click staking protocol that will help users to stake their Eth across existing protocols and compound the yields using various strategies based on the user's risk profile.

Validator Nft deals with the problem of the technical know-how user need just to stake Eth. From generating `depositData`, and operating a validator node, these are all extremely high barriers of entries to most people. The Validator Nft works by autoamtically creating a node on behalf of the user, and submitting a cryptographic proof onto the chain to represent the user ownership. In exchange, the user is given a Nft which reflects the underlying validator node.
